Treading the glacier head
And looking hard for
Moments of shine
From twilight to twilight

Aurora
I give my all to you
I hand myself over
Darling, darling

Aurora, goddess sparkle
A mountain shade suggests your shape
I tumble down on my knees
Fill my mouth with snow
The way it melts
I wish to melt into you
Aurora

Spark the sun off
Spark the sun off
Spark the sun off
Spark the sun off for me
