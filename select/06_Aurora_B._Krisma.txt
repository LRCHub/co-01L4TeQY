Go to dusky dinver I always
Go to some shady night settee
Meet a friend he loves me eveningly
So forlorn when he goes away...
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Dimness where we sit together
Ultraviolet music
Filling us nocturnal creatures
Flickering warmth inside me...
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Glossy plastic-cushioned walls
He loves the way I'm called Aurora B.
No he won't let me leave early

The night is young and so are we...
Oh, oh, oh, oh
My lips so hot I do get thirsty
I'd like to drink some cold red wine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I feel his fingers on my bare back
Yes my name's Aurora B.
I know they call him Jimmy Afterglow
Sending scintillas down my spine...
Scintillas, Oh, Oh
Scintillas, Oh, Oh
Scintillas, Oh, Oh...
